/**
 * Cross-instance pub/sub contract.
 *
 * When the server scales horizontally, instances need a shared bus (e.g. to
 * fan WebSocket notifications out to sockets connected to *other* instances,
 * or to distribute background jobs). Services depend on this interface only;
 * the driver is chosen by configuration:
 *
 *   - `memory` — single-process bus, for one instance / local dev / tests.
 *   - `redis`  — Redis pub/sub via Bun's built-in client, for multi-instance.
