/**
 * Chat business logic — rooms, messages and who wrote them. Pure of HTTP and

 * unit-tested against the in-memory repositories.
 *
 * Attaching chat to a feature, server side, is one call: open the feature's
 * room with the policy it needs before anyone joins, e.g.
 *
 *   await container.chatService().openRoom({
 *     id: `inquiry.${inquiry.id}`,
 *     policy: { retentionMs: null, backlog: { maxCount: 200, maxAgeMs: null } },
 *   });
